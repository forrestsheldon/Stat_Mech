      "Traditionally the Ising model is equilibrium interacting model with no time scale.  We only assume that the time scales of our observations are much larger than the timescales associated with the dynamics of the system.  As one of the simplest examples of an interacting system, it should also provide an opportunity to formulate an analagous non-equilibrium system.  Glauber's paper addresses this idea. It could/should therefore be thought of as a different model that is *analogous* to the Ising model.\n",
